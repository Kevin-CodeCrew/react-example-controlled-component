# An example in React that demonstrates component heirarchy along with some controlled child components and how we rely on this heirarchy to pass data up and down through the Parent and Child components (passing props down and lifting state up).

You can toggle debug using checkbox to visualize nesting of components (displays borders around parent/child components so you can visualize the hierarchy). Activating debug flag also turns console debug msg logging on if u want even more noise visible in JavaScript console.

This ain't pretty, but hopefully you can learn a thing or 2 by breaking/fixing it. rinse and repeat.
