# An example of some controlled child components that (hopefully) illustrates y that's the way 2 go. 

Also demonstrates passing props down and lifting state up.

You can toggle debug using checkbox to visualize nesting of components (displays borders around parent/child components so you can visualize the hierarchy). Activating debug flag also turns console debug msg logging on if u want even more noise visible in JavaScript console.

This ain't pretty, but hopefully you can learn a thing or 2 by breaking/fixing it.
